        <p>The main goal for this blog extension was to use TYPO3s core concepts and elements to
            provide a
            full-blown blog that
            users of TYPO3 can instantly understand and use.</p>

            <p>Blog entries are simply pages with a special page type blog entry and can be created
                and
                edited via the well-known page
                module. Creating new entries is as simple as dragging a new entry into the page
                tree.</p>
